# BigNumberAddition
This program uses linked lists to handle addition of big numbers (larger than 32 bit)
This program is to be run from CMD, the argument to be used is the name of a text file containing the numbers to be added. The format of the text file should be only one number per line, and two numbers per file.
This was made in my first year studying.
